# The contact component
## Abstract
The contact component is a core component of Qabel.
It is split into two parts:

1. On one side it holds and provides the information for communicating between the clients via drop messages (e.g. public key, drop server,..)

2. On the other side it can serve as "usual" address book for the user (e.g. store information like: address, phone number, photo,...)
