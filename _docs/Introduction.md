# Version
0.1.0 (BETA).

# What this documentation is about
This documentation describes the technical aspects of the Qabel client core.
This version often only describes the methods, protocols and features which are implemented in the release of the Beta.
This document SHALL describe Qabel technically but in a general way. However, the reader MAY find references specific to the mobile-first implementation of Qabel, which is written in Java - due to the fact that the software runs native on Android. There will also be a Beta client for Windows. It is highly possible that there will be non-Java implementations for desktop operating systems.

Each Qabel server and Qabel client app will have its own repository but the documentation will be collected in this document. The repositories from the Qabel team can be found in our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/Qabel) - just like this documentation.
