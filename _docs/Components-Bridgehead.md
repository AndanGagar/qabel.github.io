# The bridgehead component
## Abstract

The bridgehead component is a core component of Qabel. It bundles and provides the functionalities of the following components:

* [Drop component](../Components-Drop/)
* [Storage component](../Components-Storage/)
* ( Browse component -  not in beta)
* ( Sync component - not in beta)

So the bridgehead works as interface between modules and the Qabel communication layer (Qabel protocols).
