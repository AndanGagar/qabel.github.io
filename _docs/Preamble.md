The internet is broken. One of the fundamental problems is that far too many unencrypted data is flowing through the internet.

All previous approaches to fix that have failed because cloud providers make several mistakes:
Either only pure transport encryption is available for uploads or downloads or the provider has a master key and can therefore be forced to allow access to user data or metadata is incurred or the solution is closed source and thus, per se, excluded from any review and assessment as to its suitability.

Once ready to use, Qabel will mark a serious step on the path to a freer
and more secure data exchange while still being user-friendly.

It is a free, open-source (not in accordance with the OSI), expandable
platform that:
- always encrypts any data end-to-end,
- does the cryptography completely on the client side and keeps it in the hands of users,
- can depict complex services such as shared calendars, collaborative office or social networks,
- can largely obfuscate metadata (even from the host - it is not discernible who communicates with whom, when, and from where to where),
- whose entire technical architecture assumes that the provider is compromised and thus cannot be trusted,
- pursues a novel and as open as possible business model that not only permits compliant open source development but also free use and hosting by non-commercial organizations
- and functions across hosts and instances.

Assuming a wide distribution of the platform, Qabel will lead to the following secondary effects:
- Intelligence agencies no longer have any way to do mass surveillance at the touch of a button.
- Data retention and any information gathered on inventory data no longer function.
- Internet service providers will be forced to comply with network neutrality.

Because it is impossible for them to see into communications, all Qabel-based services are inherently network-neutral. Providers cannot favor any individual services since they cannot identify which services are actually used. Mechanisms such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and Quality of Service (QoS) simply do not work anymore due to the encryption. The data is transmitted undifferentiated.

Qabel ensures that any metadata is obfuscated as much as possible. Who communicates, exchanges data, uses a Qabel service when and with whom - all that remains hidden, even from the provider. The server operator can only see the total size of assignable memory.

Qabel is basically free for anyone to use, host and develop. If economic interests are paramount and money is made with Qabel, then licensing fees must be paid to Qabel GmbH, which are then invested in the continued development of Qabel. The software is published under the QaPL (Qabel Public License), which is based on other free licenses, butcontains an anti-military and intelligence agency clause stating that Qabel may not be used to, neither directly nor indirectly, restrict the
autonomy of individuals nor harm or eavesdrop on them.
The Qabel concept will be patented. The patent is then donated to a well-known, non-profit organization so that open source developers have a right to safety and are not even theoretically subject to the whims of Qabel GmbH. In this regard, too, the Hanover-based company remains true to its guiding principle that any trust in the provider can be dispensed with.
