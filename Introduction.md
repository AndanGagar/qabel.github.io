# Version
0.1.0 (BETA).

# What this documentation is about
This documentation describes the technical aspects of the Qabel client core.
This Version often only describes the methods, protocols and features which are implemented in the release of the Beta.
This document SHALL describe Qabel technically but in a general way. However, the reader MAY find references specific to the mobile-first implementation of Qabel. Which is written in Java - due to the fact that the software runs native on Android. A (Beta) Java implementation ensures easy testing on desktop machines, too. Specific desktop operating system which are supported in the Beta are Linux, OS X and Windows. It is highly possible that there will be non-Java implementations for desktop operating systems.

# What this document is **not** about
Each Qabel module, Qabel server and Qabel client app will have its own repository and documentation. The repositories and documentation from the Qabel team can be found in our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/Qabel) - just like this documentation.
